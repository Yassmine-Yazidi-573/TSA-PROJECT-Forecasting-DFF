# TSA-PROJECT-Forecasting
Absolutely — I can build a clean, professional README for your project.

Before I tailor it perfectly, just confirm one thing:

✅ **Is this project a Time Series Analysis (TSA) script/notebook that includes steps like data loading, preprocessing, stationarity tests, ARIMA/SARIMA modeling, forecasting, and visualization?**

If yes, I’ll customize the README based on that workflow.

---

### ✅ In the meantime, here’s a solid draft you can use:

# 📊 Time Series Analysis Project

## 📁 Project Overview

This project performs a full Time Series Analysis (TSA) workflow using Python. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, forecasting, and evaluation. The goal is to identify patterns in historical data and generate reliable future predictions.

The main script/notebook used in this project is:

```
Final Script TSA 02.ipynb
```

---

## ✅ Key Features

* ✅ Data loading & cleaning
* ✅ Handling missing values
* ✅ Exploratory time series visualization
* ✅ Trend & seasonality analysis
* ✅ Stationarity testing (ADF / KPSS)
* ✅ Differencing & transformations
* ✅ ARIMA / SARIMA model building
* ✅ Model selection using AIC / BIC
* ✅ Forecasting future values
* ✅ Confidence interval visualization

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Statsmodels**
* **pmdarima (auto_arima)**
* **scikit-learn** (if applicable)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Final Script TSA 02.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run all cells in sequence

> ✅ Make sure your dataset path matches the code in the notebook.

## 📈 Results

* Visualized historical patterns
* Identified trend/seasonality
* Built a forecasting model
* Generated future predictions with confidence intervals

(You can attach sample plots here.)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add model comparison (Prophet, LSTM, VAR, etc.)
* Automate hyperparameter tuning
* Deploy forecasting API or dashboard
* Save model as a pickle file for reuse

### ✅ Want a Fully Customized README?

If you want:

* Your dataset name included
* Specific model details
* Plots or results summarized
* A polished “Project Motivation” section

Just tell me:
📌 What data you analyzed
📌 What model you ended up using
📌 Any key results

I’ll tailor the README perfectly to your project.
